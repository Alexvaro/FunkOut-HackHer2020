This project was created  for HackHer, an all-female hackathon run by Queens University. My team and I designed an app called "Funk Out!", a virtual
socialization app aimed at getting users out of the "funk" of quarantine and to take care of their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Our project consisted of two compnents: 
(1) the UI design via Figma that takes users through the layout and logical flow of the app, and 
(2) the rewards system. In order to encourage usage within the app and therefore increased mental wellbeing amongst users, I built a rewards system in Python 
that reads usage hours from a CSV file and turns those hours into specific rewards levels. Each reward level can be redeemed for specialized prizes that 
in turn encourage the user to use the app further and care for their mental health.
